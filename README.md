# Unit-02-CSS-and-Bootstrap

Purpose
-in this assignment we demonstrated our basic knowledge of css and html by putting together a web page that contained an AboutMe page, a Contact page, and a Portfolio page

AboutMe
-the AboutMe page demonstrated the application of Lorem, wrapping text around an image, while establishing a nav-bar with links to the other pages.

Contact
-the Contact page demonstrated the application of forms in what would later be a staple in future applications

Portfolio
-the Portfolio page demonstrated the application of importing multiple images

Struggles
-When this assignment was first created I struggled to find the proper way of styling.  Instead I often used specific margins and padding to make the page appear as I believe it should have been.  This however only applied in a page that was stagnant and if the page was restored down or reshaped the specific margins wouldn't account for these changes and it would appear incorrect.

Accomplishment
-My biggest accomplishment when I made this assignment was getting hrefs to work, both for the css styling and creating the hyperlinks.

Future Edits
-When my knowledge of CSS and HTML had expanded I returned to polish up this assignment.  I tried to keep the spirit of what I originally had made while correcting those margin errors, cleaning up the appearance of my code, and putting in more appropriate images with styling that didn't compress the images.  Looking back I see how far I have come in only a matter on months.  Knowing where I began and where I am now is the most potent source of motivation there is to continue, knowing that where I am now will seem equally distanced if not more than where I will be in the future.
